# Mental Health in Tech Industry Analysis

This project investigates the factors influencing mental health treatment-seeking behavior among tech industry employees. Utilizing data science techniques, we explore various personal and workplace-related factors to understand their impact on mental health awareness and treatment outcomes.

### Project Overview
**Objective:** To identify and analyze key factors affecting mental health treatment-seeking behavior in the tech industry.
<br>
**Data Source:** Utilized the "OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey" dataset, featuring responses from tech industry professionals on mental health conditions, workplace environment, and treatment-seeking behavior.
<br>
**Tools & Technologies:** Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook.

### Key Features Analyzed
**Demographic Variables:** Age, Gender
<br>
**Personal Factors:** Family History of Mental Health Issues
<br>
**Workplace Environment:** Company Size, Ease of Taking Medical Leave, Openness in Discussing Mental Health with Employers and Coworkers
<br>
**Resources Availability:** Availability and Awareness of Mental Health Resources

### Analysis Steps
**Data Collection:** Acquired the dataset from the OSMI initiative and relevant platforms.
<br>
**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Processed the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. Structured the data for analysis.
<br>
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Investigated distributions, trends, and correlations.
Analyzed mental health issues variation by demographics, company size, and workplace environment.
<br>
**Statistical Analysis:**
Conducted Chi-Squared tests to explore associations between categorical variables and treatment-seeking behavior.
Identified statistically significant predictors.
<br>
**Predictive Modeling:**
Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict mental health treatment outcomes.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Results & Insights
**Statistically Significant Predictors:** Gender, Family History, Ease of Taking Medical Leave, Discussing Mental Health with Employer, Resources Availability.
<br>
**Model Performance:** Logistic Regression provided a good balance of accuracy and interpretability. Random Forest highlighted the importance of family history and workplace environment in treatment-seeking behavior.
<br>
**Workplace Environment:** A supportive workplace environment, including ease of taking medical leave and discussing mental health openly, was associated with higher likelihoods of seeking treatment.

### Conclusion
These models underscore the multifaceted influences on mental health treatment-seeking behavior, highlighting the importance of both individual factors (like family history and gender) and environmental factors (like workplace culture and support). Project underscores the significant role of both personal factors and workplace environment in influencing mental health treatment-seeking among tech industry professionals. By leveraging data science methodologies, we derived actionable insights that can inform policy-making and foster a more supportive culture towards mental health in the tech industry.
